/// incorrectly be double acquired) whereas  `FSLockFactory` worked perfectly in those same
/// environments.  For NFS based access to an index, it's
/// recommended that you try `SimpleFSLockFactory`
/// first and work around the one limitation that a lock file
/// could be left when the JVM exits abnormally.
///
/// The primary benefit of `NativeFSLockFactory` is
/// that locks (not the lock file itsself) will be properly
/// removed (by the OS) if the JVM has an abnormal exit.
///
/// Note that, unlike `SimpleFSLockFactory`, the existence of
/// leftover lock files in the filesystem is fine because the OS
/// will free the locks held against these files even though the
